The sense slowly drifted from the original papers (such as Science, Vol. 241, No. 4871, 1988, pp. 1299-1306. by T. J. Sejnowski, C. Koch, P. S. Churchland) which I believed is perfectly captured in the sentence: \"The ultimate aim of computational neuroscience is to explain how electrical and chemical signals are used in the brain to represent and process information.\"  (this does not exclude using computers of course).\\n\\nIt seems to be solely a semantical problem, but this may generate some confusion (realpolitik translation: \"and this may hinder the efficiency of your grant proposal\"). Recently an (anonymous) colleague told me they called their group \"computational AND theoretical neuroscience\" (just as these two fields where separated) out of the lack of consensus on the meaning of words and to not exclude anyone.
