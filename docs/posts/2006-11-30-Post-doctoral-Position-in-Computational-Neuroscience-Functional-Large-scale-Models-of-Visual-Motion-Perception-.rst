  The position has been filled

We are currently inviting applications for a postdoctoral position in
computational neuroscience to study functional, large-scale models of
visual motion perception. The post is for up to 3 years in the `DyVA
team <http://www.incm.cnrs-mrs.fr/en_equipedyva.php>`__ at the
`INCM <http://www.incm.cnrs-mrs.fr/>`__ (CNRS) in Marseille, France and
will be funded within the european
`FACETS <http://facets.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/public/index.html>`__
consortium.

.. TEASER_END

The project will involve developing, designing and implementing
large-scale neural networks of the primary visual areas. The goal is to
bridge theoretical principles of computations, physiological data (e.g.
optical imaging) and behavioral data (e.g. eye movements) to bring new
understanding on the neural computations underlying the perception of
motion. We are particularly interested in the dynamics of motion
integration, focusing on responses to complex motion stimuli in areas V1
and V5/MT. Our theoretical approaches span from `statistical
inference <https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/perrinet-06-fens>`__ to `adaptive
distributed representations <https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/perrinet-19-hulk>`__
to provide insights into these parallel, dynamical processes. We use
state-of-the-art simulation software to validate these results thanks to
our computer facilities, with the goal of transferring this technology
to aVLSI chips developped within the consortium.

The DyVA team is a young CNRS pluridisciplinary research team (Head:
`Dr. Guillaume
Masson <http://www.incm.cnrs-mrs.fr/publications.php?nomch=Masson>`__)
integrating research on eye movements and visual perception at both
behavioral (psychophysics, motor control) and physiological (optical
imaging, electrophysiology) levels. The computational project will be
conducted by Dr. Laurent Perrinet in close collaboration with other
FACETS teams (`Pr. O.
Faugeras <http://www-sop.inria.fr/robotvis/personnel/faugeras/faugeras-eng.html>`__,
INRIA,Sophia-Antipolis, `Pr. Ad
Aertsen <http://www.brainworks.uni-freiburg.de/group/aertsen/>`__,
Freiburg, `Pr. W. Maass <http://www.igi.tugraz.at/maass/>`__, Graz, `Pr.
Y. Fregnac <http://www.unic.cnrs-gif.fr/indexEn.htm>`__, CNRS, Paris).
The work conducted in Marseille will involve a PhD Student and a
Computer Engineer together with the post-doctoral fellow. Close
interactions within the team with the biological tasks conducted
(optical imaging in awake monkey) are promoted.

The postdoc will work as part of a European wide research team based on
a new EU-funded Integrated Project entitled "FACETS: Fast Analog
Computing with Transient States". The FACETS project is a major 11
million Euros, four-year research project funded by the European Union.
The stated objective of FACETS is to explore and exploit the
computational principles that constitute the basis of information
processing in the brain. The project involves all facets of neuroscience
from experimental neuroscience ("in vivo"), the construction of models
and analytical descriptions for neural cells and networks ("in
computo"), to the construction of very large scale neural circuits in
VLSI technology ("in silico"). The FACETS consortium includes fifteen of
the major laboratories in Europe in these areas. One of the goals of the
FACETS consortium is to develop a large-scale model of the primary
visual cortex and explore its computational capabilities for solving
low-level motion tasks involving short- and long-range lateral
interactions.

Expertise in computational modeling as well as mathematical and
programming skills are required. A keen interest in neuroscience is
necessary to ensure the tight coupling of the computational approach
with experiments done in the lab. The position is available immediately,
the appointment will be for a fixed term of up to three years, ending
31st August 2009.

`Marseille <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille>`__ is a major french
town by the `mediterranean
sea <http://perso.numericable.fr/~proudhonh/calma/planche_calanques.html>`__
with a lively atmosphere and cultural life. The DyVA team is located in
a `CNRS
campus <http://www.cnrs.fr/provence/delegation/Accueil_Delegation/Campus_du_GLM/;view>`__
with excellent research facilities. Net salary is about 1800â‚¬/month,
full social coverage included.

Interested candidates should send their application materials - cover
letter, CV, statement of research interests and research experience (no
.doc file, please) or informal enquiries to Dr. `Laurent
Perrinet <https://invibe.net/LaurentPerrinet/ContactInformation>`__ (
