#. Example from a recent email:

   -  "I am offering a new class, Email Intelligence, *that/which* may
      be an excellent fit for your training needs and budget."
   -  Does the clause (in red) introduce information that is essential
      to knowing which Email Intelligence class?
   -  No. The clause provides extra information, so which is correct.

#. Revised example:

   -  "Among my new programs, I am offering a class *that/which* may be
      an excellent fit for your training needs and budget."
   -  Does the clause (in red) introduce information that is essential
      to knowing which class?
   -  Yes. The clause tells which class--a class that may be an
      excellent fit. Therefore, that is correct.
