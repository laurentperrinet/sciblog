    "Plaids are usually created by adding two moving gratings (the components) to form a new simulus (the pattern). Such stimuli are crucial to understand how for instance information about motion is represented and processed and its neural mechanisms have been extensively studied notably by Anthony Movshon at the NYU.\n",
    "One shortcomming is the fact that these are created by components which created interference patterns when they are added (as in a Moir√© pattern). The question remains to know if everything that we know about components vs pattern processing comes from these interference patterns or reaaly by the processing of the two componenents as a whole.\n",
    "As such, Motion Clouds are ideal candidates because they are generated with random phases: by construction, there should not be any localized interference between components. Let's verfy that:"
