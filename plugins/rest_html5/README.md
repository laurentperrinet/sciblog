Modified version of original reST plugin that uses an [alternative docutils writer](https://bitbucket.org/andre_felipe_dias/rst2html5) to produce HTML5 output.

**Note:** if you want to use the Nikola-provided reST extensions, you need to
keep the original `rest` compiler in COMPILERS *and* POSTS/PAGES, otherwise
they will not get loaded.
