Subject: `Coordination
meeting <https://facets.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/private/wiki/index.php/Marseille_November2006>`__
of the
`WP9T2 <https://facets.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/private/wiki/index.php/WP9T2>`__
and
`WP5T3 <https://facets.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/private/wiki/index.php/WP5T3>`__
tasks.

-  The goal of the meeting was to prepare the next deliverable D25
   ("model of an hyper-column") but also to join our efforts in
   modeling. In particular, important decisions were made toward finding
   canonical parameters (structure, neural parameters) of all systems
   being delivered in WP5T3 and WP9T2 but also concerning the definition
   of the common benchmark that will de deployed to the different
   implementations in the different partners. From this benchmark
   (benchmark zero), we should be able to validate different solutions
   to pinpoint their strengths and weaknesses.

   discussion <https://facets.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/forum/viewtopic.php?t=111%20discussion>`__
   on D25 should take place in the appropriate forum... and on the
   `WP9T2 <https://facets.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/private/wiki/index.php/WP9T2>`__
   and
   `WP5T3 <https://facets.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/private/wiki/index.php/WP5T3>`__
   wiki pages.

Main points and decisions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  review / demonstration of coding strategies by different partners.
   This definition has impact on the "Meta Simulator",
-  review of existing V1 models inside and outside FACETS (see also
   !Review\_of\_V1\_models),
-  definition of the common benchmark
   `FACETS\_Benchmarks <https://facets.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/private/wiki/index.php/FACETS_Benchmarks>`__
   to qualitatively compare different models and strategies in order to
   break the *model complexity barrier*, as we began to do for the
   simulator,
-  definition of the architecture of the FACETS model of an
   "hyper-column" by defining the priorities of different partners:
   effect of including different neuron types, including layers,
   specific lateral connectivity.
-  Partner 13 (Plymouth, Mike Denham) will provide an hypercolumn for
   D25.
-  Partner 6b will provide a retina before Dec. 15 for implementing
   benchmark zero.
