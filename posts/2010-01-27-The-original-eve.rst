-  one common statement in popular science when speaking about evolution
   is that we all derive from a common ancestor, the "original eve".
   while *a posteriori*, it is true that mitochodrondrial DNA allows to
   trace back common ancestors in our heredity, it is certainly
   overstated. When thinking evolution, our focus is to look back from
   the present to our origins, but a the time of these "few" original
   eves, *many* different eves coexisted and acted -as parts of the
   whole population- in the evolution.

-  Evolution is more like a Banyan tree than a graph written on a board
   where species evolve from primitive forms into more and more complex
   forms, including an idealistic vision of our position on this tree.
-  even worse for the gap between reality and popular preconceptions
   about evolution: evolution is also *lateral*. More on this subject @
