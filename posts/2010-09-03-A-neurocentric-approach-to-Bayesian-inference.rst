-  one-page paper arguing that Friston's free-energy view may not be
   complete. Some points made are

   #. the inversion operated assumes a generative model
   #. the use of surprise is defined using a frequentist approach not
      informational

      -  one idea : from the frequentist measure one one can derive a
         conditional probability (a Xhi-2 distribution) of the
         probability. Not very far to the idea of Sahani & Dayan of a
         double probabilistic distribution


   #. explore surprise or avoid it: Fiorillo makes here a confusion of
      time scales. On the long term (learning) one tends to avoid
      surprise, on the short term (coding) this implies one jumps one
      surprise.
   #. points to his PLoS one paper: Fiorillo, C. D. Towards a general
      theory of neural computation based on prediction by single
      neurons. `PLoS ONE 3, e3298
      (2008) <http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0003298>`__

.. TEASER_END


-  once again, people love bipolarity: frequentists against
   probabilists, top-down vs. bottom-up, neurocentric vs global.
   neurons, areas, brains, groups of brains just don't care and evolve.
   it is our description that can be multiple. does a single one
   ("unified theory") exists iun today's language? at least I am
   convinced that (over generations) neurons adapt to behavior not the
   inverse, thus that if one has to seek for an information measure, it
   is certainly not in a ion's channel dynamic *only*.
-  the answer of Friston goes into that direction / correctly defines
   surprise / nice figure showing how one can learn "to be a Lorenz
   attractor" (certainly assuming a generative model of dynamics)
-  the open question is rather "how is the free-energy principle encoded
   in the brain's architecture and dynamics?"

   A primary function of the brain is to infer the state of the world in
   order to determine which motor behaviours will best promote adaptive
   fitness. Bayesian probability theory formally describes how rational
   inferences ought to be made, and it has been used with great success
   in recent years to explain a range of perceptual and sensorimotor
   phenomena1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
