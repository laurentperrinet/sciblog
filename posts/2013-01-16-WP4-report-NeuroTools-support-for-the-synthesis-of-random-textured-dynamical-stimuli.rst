In the context of `BrainScales <http://invibe.net/LaurentPerrinet/BrainScales>`__, we
have developed a library to synthesize stimuli targeted at the
characterization of motion perception. This process took the following
steps:


.. TEASER_END


-  creation of the library using python and linked with the development
   of `NeuroTools <http://invibe.net/LaurentPerrinet/NeuroTools>`__,
-  documentation of this library along with a mathematical description,
   published in the Journal of Neurophysiology, while this stimuli were
   at the basis of a paper published in Nature Neuroscience (both
   acknowledging BrainScaleS)
-  dissemination of this tool by creating a dedicated webpage associated
   to the "neuralensemble organization" which also host neo and pyNN.

These steps were recently described in deliverable D4-1.1:
