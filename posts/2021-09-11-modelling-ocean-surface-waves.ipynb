    "Trying to model Ocean surface waves, I have played using a [linear superposition of sinusoids](https://laurentperrinet.github.io/sciblog/posts/2014-10-24_a-bit-of-fun-with-gravity-waves.html) and also on the fact that [phase speed (following a wave's crest) is twice as fast as group speed (following a group of waves)](https://laurentperrinet.github.io/sciblog/posts/2016-04-24_a-wave-going-backwards.html). Finally, I more recently used such generation of a model of the random superposition of waves to model the [wigggling lines formed by the refraction (bendings of the trajectory of a ray at the interface between air and water) of light, called caustics](https://laurentperrinet.github.io/sciblog/posts/2020-06-19-caustic-optics.html)...\n",

    "Observing real-life ocean waves instructed me that if a single wave is well approximated by a sinuso√Ød, it is qualitatively a bit different. Typical for these surface gravity waves are [the sharp crests and flat troughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes_wave). As a matter of fact, modelling ocean waves is on one side very useful (modelling tides, tsunamis, diffraction in a bay to predict coastline evolution, ...) but quite demanding despite a [well known mathematical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airy_wave_theory). Starting with the Navier-Stokes equations to an incompressible fluid (water) in a gravitational field leads to [Luke's variational principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke%27s_variational_principle) in certain simplifying conditions. Further simplifications lead to the approximate solution given by Stokes w:\n",
